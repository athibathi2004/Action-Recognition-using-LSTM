# Action-Recognition-using-LSTM
A Deep Learning Project
A webcam-enabled action recognition coupled with multilingual Translation: This work proposes a novel way of real-time action recognition in human subjects and translation into diverse linguistics. Till today, artificial intelligence concerning human-computer-interaction secures the role of utilizing our system in an easily accessible manner for interpreted performance in various languages related to real-time actions. 
    This work proposes the design of an action recognition system that will try to address these challenges by combining real-time landmark detection and tracking using the Mediapipe framework with LSTM-based neural networks that recognize a wide variety of actions. Besides detection, our system is designed to bridge the gap between recognized actions and meaningful communication through translating those actions into pre-defined sentences that are contextually relevant.
    These sentences can then be translated into multiple languages to enable the user to communicate easily with people of higher linguistic backgrounds. For better application, we have integrated our system with the feature of communication in which those sentences can be sent as an SMS or on WhatsApp. That gives the system not just a simple recognition tool but an accessible communication aid valuable in applications ranging from health care to emergency response.
    The system sends messages through the Twilio API for SMS and uses the official WhatsApp Business API for WhatsApp, allowing messages to reach recipients quickly. This real-time messaging capability is particularly useful in cases requiring users to seek help quickly or in a quicker manner without needing to type manually or call.
